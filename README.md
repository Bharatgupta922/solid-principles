# 🌟 SOLID Principles in JavaScript

Welcome to the **SOLID Principles in JavaScript** repository! This project demonstrates the five core SOLID design principles with clear, practical JavaScript examples. Each principle is explained and showcased in its own file, making it easy to learn and reference.

## ✨ What are SOLID Principles?

**SOLID** is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

   git clone <repo-url>
   cd solid-principles
   ```
2. **Install Node.js** (if not already installed):
   [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

3. **Run the main file:**
   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```

## 🖥️ Example Output

```
SOLID Principles in JavaScript (SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable):

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.
[SRP Example Output]

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification. You should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code.
[OCP Example Output]

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.
[LSP Example Output]

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Split large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.
[ISP Example Output]

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
[DIP Example Output]
```

## 💡 Why SOLID?

Applying SOLID principles leads to:
- Cleaner, more maintainable code
- Easier testing and debugging
- Greater flexibility for future changes
- Better collaboration in teams
